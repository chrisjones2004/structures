When you select elements individually an undoable edit doesnt get created

Need to sort out textface, when you type help it should ask you what you want to do
1. Add Elements
2. Modify Elements - Currently not supported
3. Select Elements



should elements be firing ElementEvents when there data is changed. ie so get rid of index-event.

//Need to add JUnit tests


//Should results have their own evenetobject??

//ElementModel em = truss.getElementModel(elements.get(0));
his wont work if we want on undo for multiple delete undo/redo

//The class AnalysisMethods should really have hashmap of all anayzers, That way menus and regression tools
can automatically update them selves instead of hardcoding analysis names!
//All classes should have private static class of public fields which need to be listed

//Element classes should all have hashmaps so gui component such as BarPropertiesPanel restraint combo box can pick
them up automiatically if they change.

//Dont like the updateNumbers method and the way element have their own number
//Maybe should have hashmap of elements instead i.e ?? will solve this problem

//Section should not extend Element!!

//when optimizer stops it should set it to stop


//zoom all function still doenst work




//Seems to be a problem with material density and graivty swapping around??



//Maybe BarTableModel should implement ListSelectionListner so that we just have one selection model


//Get rid of all TrussModel.OPERATION_IDLE, OPERATION_MASS_ADDING etc. Replace with mass adding event.
if arg instanceof MassAddEWvent then update = false
if arg instanceof MassEventFinished then update = trues

//Set truss.getOperation() == TrussModel.MASS_REMOVING) this is barTable to be equal to IDLE and for all other tables

//After optimization is finished, if sections have been optimized, all final sections should be added to my avaibale sections listmodel





//Should be able to highlight by selecting item in output tabs, either revert to old methods or use custom listlistnermodel

//Should have boolean in gui, called saved, not saved should be used where notAnalyzed is used

//Add cut,copy, paste, 

//When adding load should check that are there none on before adding, I dont like this maybe change structure slightly to allow
//multiple loads to be on a node.



//more checking in trusscreator methods
//crashes if you specify only 1 field







Long term projects

//Fix object inspector
//Add help dialog
